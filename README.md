> **Strip the AI packaging. Keep the meaning.**

Detects and rewrites AI writing patterns in Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese. Runs as a skill for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), [Cursor](https://cursor.sh), and OpenCode, or as a standalone Node.js CLI.

Unlike a generic paraphraser, patina is **pattern-based and auditable**: it shows what it changed, why it changed it, and whether the original claims were preserved.

## Demo

**Before** *(AI-sounding)*:
> Coffee has emerged as a **pivotal cultural phenomenon** that has **fundamentally transformed** social interactions across the globe. This beloved beverage serves as a catalyst for community building, fosters meaningful connections, and facilitates cross-cultural dialogue.

**After** *(`/patina --lang en` — same claims, AI packaging removed)*:
> Coffee has quietly changed how people meet. Sit across from someone long enough, and something like a real connection tends to form — even between people from very different cultures.

> **MPS = 100** · cultural transformation ✓ · community building ✓ · meaningful connections ✓ · cross-cultural dialogue ✓

## Quick Start

### As a Claude Code or Codex CLI skill

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devswha/patina/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer wires patina into Claude Code, [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), Cursor, and OpenCode. Then:

```
/patina --lang en

[paste your text here]
```

Rewrite with a specific tone:

```
/patina --tone narrative

[paste your essay draft here]
```

Auto-detect and apply the best-fit tone:

```
/patina --tone auto --lang en

[paste your text here]
```

### As a standalone CLI

Requires Node.js ≥ 18.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devswha/patina.git
cd patina && npm install && npm link
patina --lang en input.txt
```

> 🆓 **No API key required** if you have the [`codex`](https://github.com/openai/codex) CLI logged in. See [AUTHENTICATION.md](docs/AUTHENTICATION.md) for the full backend list.

## Modes

```
patina --lang <ko|en|zh|ja> [mode] [--profile <name>] input.txt
```

| Flag | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| *(default)* | Rewrite |
| `--audit` | Detect AI patterns only |
| `--score` | 0–100 AI-likeness score with category breakdown |
| `--diff` | Show changes pattern by pattern |
| `--ouroboros` | Iterate the rewrite until score converges (with MPS rollback) |
| `--lang <ko\|en\|zh\|ja>` | Select language (default: `ko`) |
| `--profile <name>` | Tone preset: `blog`, `academic`, `technical`, `formal`, `social`, `email`, `legal`, `medical`, `marketing`, `narrative`, `instructional`, `casual-conversation` |
| `--tone <name>` | Tone category: `casual`, `professional`, `academic`, `narrative`, `marketing`, `instructional`, `auto` |
| `--batch` | Treat positional args as a list of files (e.g. `--batch docs/*.md`) |

`patina --help` for the full flag list.

### Score-only patterns

`--score` and `--audit` measure a slightly broader set of signals than `--rewrite` does. The viral-hook packs (`ko/en/zh/ja-viral-hook`, 5 patterns each: shock-number hooks, clickbait closings, source-skipping authority claims, breath-optimized short-sentence stacking, hyperbolic engagement lexicon) are **detection-only** — they surface in the score and audit so the benchmark matches human intuition for SNS-style marketing copy across all four languages, but `--rewrite`/`--diff`/`--ouroboros` skip them because those signals are often intentional rhetoric. Real-world demos: [`examples/viral-hook/`](examples/viral-hook/).

### Prompt-mode tuning (v3.11)

`--prompt-mode strict|minimal|auto` lets you trade off between the full pattern packs (~34KB structured prompt) and a compressed casual instruction (~3KB). `auto` picks per backend — Gemini does better on minimal (it gets over-constrained by long structured prompts), while Claude leverages the full packs and Codex is roughly insensitive. case-05 documents the A/B.

### Multiple stylistic variants (v3.11)

`--variants <1-5>` asks the model for N voice variants of the rewrite in one call (e.g., V1 casual, V2 direct, V3 measured) — facts, numbers, and causation stay identical across variants. Each comes back as `## Variant N` so you can pick the voice you want.

### Short-text scoring boost (v3.11)

For inputs ≤200 chars or ≤3 paragraphs, register-sensitive categories (`language`, `style`, `viral-hook`) get a 1.5× severity multiplier so single-paragraph voice shifts surface in the score. case-04 found these were undercounted by the long-text formula.

### Self-audit isolation (v3.11)

In rewrite mode, the model emits its self-audit notes inside `[SELF_AUDIT]`/`[/SELF_AUDIT]` tags wrapped around a `[BODY]`/`[/BODY]` block (or `[VARIANT n]` blocks when `--variants > 1`). patina strips the audit before showing the user, so raw output is clean — earlier versions sometimes leaked phrases like "남아 있는 AI 티" or "Phase 3" preambles into the user-facing text.

### Score weight drift detection (v3.11)

`--score` runs cross-check the Weight column the model emits against your config's `category-weights`. If the model invents a category (e.g., `discord`) or substitutes a different number, `[patina]` warnings hit stderr — observability only, the score itself isn't altered.

## Tones

`--tone` selects a named voice axis applied on top of pattern rewriting. Resolution order: `--tone` CLI > `tone:` config > `profile:` config.

| Tone | Intended for | Key behaviors |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| `casual` | Blog posts, social content, personal notes | Contractions, first-person, emoticons OK, low formality |
| `professional` | Work emails, reports, business writing | Clear and concise, formal but not stiff; legal/medical sub-profiles force fidelity floor |
| `academic` | Papers, research summaries, technical analysis | Objective, evidence-oriented, minimal first-person |
| `narrative` | Personal essays, memoir, experience-based writing | First-person anchor, scene detail, emotional presence, time flow |
| `marketing` | Ad copy, landing pages, product announcements | Short impact sentences, persuasive, CTA-friendly |
| `instructional` | Tutorials, how-to guides, technical docs | Imperative verbs, numbered structure, hedging suppressed |

`--tone auto` runs heuristic detection (lexical + structural signals) and selects the best-fit tone. zh/ja with any tone (including `auto`) emits a warning and falls back to profile-only mode — Phase 4.5b heuristics only cover ko/en.

### MAX mode

Run the same text through Claude, Codex, and Gemini independently. The lowest AI-score result that passes MPS ≥ 70 wins:

```
/patina-max

[paste your text here]
```

## How It Works

```
Input
  ↓
[Step 4.5]   Semantic anchor extraction (claims, polarity, causation, numbers)
[Step 4.6]   Stylometric pre-pass (burstiness CV + MATTR)
[Step 4.7]   AI-lexicon overlap (~108 EN / 102 KO entries)
[Phase 1]    Structure scan + anchor verification
[Phase 2]    Sentence rewrite + anchor verification
[Phase 3]    Self-audit (polarity, regression, MPS)
  ↓
Natural-sounding text (meaning verified)
```

If meaning drifts at any verification step, the change is retried or rolled back.

**Calibration** *(500-paragraph corpus, reproducible via `.omc/research/v3_8_remeasure.py`)*: 76% AI catch on HC3 ChatGPT (en), 91% on paired ko/AI corpus, 13–25% FP on human prose. Acceptance gates: AI ≥ 75%, max FP ≤ 25%. See [stylometry.md](core/stylometry.md) for the algorithm.

## Configuration

```yaml
# .patina.default.yaml
version: "3.11.0"
language: ko              # ko | en | zh | ja
profile: default
output: rewrite           # rewrite | diff | audit | score
tone:                     # casual | professional | academic | narrative | marketing | instructional | auto
max-models: [claude, gemini]
```

Pattern packs are auto-discovered by language prefix. `.patina.yaml` in the working directory overrides defaults.
